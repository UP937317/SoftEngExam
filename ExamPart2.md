SCRAMBLES Ltd do not want to use an agile development process as they think this
is very adhoc and is too similar to their existing style. In reality they do not
have a software development process, they are just hacking. You have to convince
the senior management to pick a suitable software development model. Propose,
describe and justify a software development process, then compare and contrast
your selected model with the existing *hacking* development process.

a) Clearly state which Software Process Model you are proposing.

b) Present a comparison table of your process versus the existing *hacking*
process; your rationale MUST be specific to the given scenario.

a) For this part i will be using Iterative software developing process

b)

| reason | hacking | Iterative | Example |
| ------ | ------- | --------- | ------ |
| Specification | Specifications are set at the begining, If they woulld change multiple times, it would cause chaos. | Specifications can be changed in the process and would not couse any major disturbence it the process. | If new features would be needed for the coops, after too many modification it would be very hard to organize them. |
| Design | Design is only cosidered when someone has a new idea. | New design features are considered on each iteration and are used to adapt dynamic market conditions. | |
| Testing | Testing is done on the go, each time new piece of code is written, it is tested | Testing would happen at the end of each itereation. | |
| Maintenance | Maintenance is very chaotic after some period of time when system becomes larger. | Maintenance stays the same and easy  no matter of system size. | |
| Documentations | Lack of documentation. | Documentation is generated on each iteration in the process. | |
