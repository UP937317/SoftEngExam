The M30819 Coursework CW[1:5] required you to work in groups to design and develop a
medium-size 3-tier software system within an application domain.

The final artifact was a 4-page retrospective account of the group project
describing, but not limited to:

* what worked
* what did not work
* how the risks were met
* any limitations with estimates

The retrospective account provided examples of lessons learned and
guidelines for mitigating problems in future team projects.

Reflect on *your* personal experience within the
group. Compare your reflective account with the 3-page retrospective account
submitted by your group.

You may want to:

* describe any problems of scale in the group software development
* provide a critical analysis of the problems within your group project
* reflect on the technical and process solutions you applied to the software
  development
* suggest improvements that you would implement if starting this group project
