You have decided to use GitHub as your Software Configuration Management (SCM)
system because it is a popular, feature rich and SCRAMBLES Ltd have previous
experience with this tool.

This exam **must** be submitted via GitHub using this repository. It is
private and accessible only to you.

a) There are 7 files in this repository that you will edit for this mock exam parts 1-7. They are written in Markdown.

* In each of the 7 files replace the Student ID placeholder (UPXXXXXX) with your
  StudentID. (Approx line ~4 of each of the seven files, see example below)

    > Student ID: UP1234567

* Commit these changes to Git

* Push the changes to GitHub

* On the master branch. Verify that your Student ID is visible on each file using the GitHub webpage. Ensure you can see your Student ID as shown in the
  example below (e.g. UP1234567).

b) You will probably generate images for some Parts 2-7. If you do they must be linked into the Markdown as only the Markdown files will be graded.
Please insert the University Logo into **this** Markdown file so that it is visible on GitHub.

* The University logo is stored in the images folder of this repository `images/UoPLogo.jpg`.
* Edit end of the ExamPart1.md file to include the image
* Commit the changes and push to GitHub.
* Using a web browser go to Github and view the Markdown file. The image must be visible on the webpage.

> This is how you should include images if required for Parts 2-7

c) Marks will be allocated for the use of Markdown and GitHub in all Parts 2-7.
