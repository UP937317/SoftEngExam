a) Draw ONE architectural diagram that captures all the components of the
SCRAMBLES Ltd scenario. Include at least the following components: Mobile phone
app, Coop Door, Temperature logger.

b) Provide a short description of the component relationships. This can be
either as a separate table or shown as labels on the architectural diagram.

c) Describe in fewer than **50** words:

* one limitation that your chosen architecture imposes on the SCRAMBLES
  coop door

OR

* one feature your chosen architecture enables. For example a feature
  that will help SCRAMBLES Ltd sell more coop doors. It must be a new feature
  that is not listed in the scenario and must be a feature that the end user
  needs.
